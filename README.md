# City Weather (Open‑Meteo)

## Overview
A minimal web page that fetches and displays the current temperature and humidity for any city using the Open‑Meteo public APIs (Geocoding + Forecast). Styled with Bootstrap 5, no build tools required.

## Setup
- No installation needed. Just open index.html in any modern browser.
- Optional: serve locally (recommended for best CORS and file access behavior)
  - Using Python: python3 -m http.server
  - Or use a lightweight dev server / VS Code Live Server.

## Usage
1. Open index.html.
2. Enter a city name (e.g., “London” or “Paris, FR”).
3. Click “Get Weather” or press Enter.
4. The page shows:
   - Temperature (with units)
   - Relative Humidity (with %)
   - Location details and last update time
