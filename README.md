# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
A lightweight, client-side weather dashboard that shows current conditions and a 3‑day forecast. Users can search by city, toggle temperature units between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and view small weather icons for quick status.

Powered by the Open‑Meteo API (no API key required).

## Setup
- Download the repository files.
- Open index.html in any modern browser. No build step or server required.

## Usage
- Enter a city name (e.g., "London") and click Search.
- Toggle °C/°F using the unit switch; values update automatically.
- The top card shows current temperature, condition, and wind.
- The 3‑Day Forecast table lists day, icon, highs/lows, and conditions.
- If allowed, the app auto-detects your location on first load.

## Improvements in Round 2
- Added a 3-day forecast table below the current weather section.
- Added a Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle that updates both current and forecast data.
- Displayed small weather icons for both current conditions and forecast rows.
